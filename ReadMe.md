# E-Commerce Flutter App

**A collaborative e-commerce mobile app built with Flutter and Firebase**  

This project is a **team-developed e-commerce application** built using **Flutter** for the frontend and **Firebase** for backend services. The app demonstrates **role-based authentication** for **Admins**, **Sellers**, and **Clients**, allowing tailored workflows for each user type.  

> ⚠️ Note: The live app cannot currently run because the Firebase free trial has expired, but the project structure, code, and logic are fully implemented.

## Key Features

### Role-Based Authentication
- Users are classified as **Admin**, **Seller**, or **Client**.  
- Login redirects users to role-specific dashboards.  
- Password reset via **email** or **previous password**.  

### Admin Dashboard
- Manage users and roles (approve sellers, manage clients).  
- Moderate products uploaded by sellers.  
- Monitor platform analytics (sales, orders, users).  

### Seller Dashboard
- Add, edit, and delete products.  
- Track orders and manage inventory.  
- Update account info and reset password securely.  

### Client Dashboard
- Browse and search products.  
- Add products to cart and place orders.  
- Track orders and manage account info.  

### Account Management
- Full CRUD operations on user accounts.  
- Secure password update and recovery.  
- Real-time updates synced with Firebase (when active).  

## Technical Stack

- **Backend:** Firebase Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage  
- **State Management:** Provider / Riverpod  
- **Architecture:** MVC / Modular structure for team development  

## Team Collaboration
- Developed collaboratively using **GitHub** for version control.  
- Agile workflow with **feature branches**.  
- Pull requests and code reviews to ensure quality and teamwork.
